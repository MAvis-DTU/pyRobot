# An action class must implement three types be a valid action:
# 1) is_applicable(self, agent_index, state) which return a boolean describing whether this action is valid for
#    the agent with 'agent_index' to perform in 'state' independently of any other action performed by other agents.
# 2) result(self, agent_index, state) which modifies the 'state' to incorporate the changes caused by the agent
#    performing the action. Since we *always* call both 'is_applicable' and 'conflicts' prior to calling 'result',
#    there is no need to check for correctness.
# 3) conflicts(self, agent_index, state) which returns information regarding potential conflicts with other actions
#    performed concurrently by other agents. More specifically, conflicts can occur with regard to the following
#    two invariants:
#    A) Two objects may not have the same destination.
#       Ex: '0  A1' where agent 0 performs Move(E) and agent 1 performs Push(W,W)
#    B) Two agents may not move the same box concurrently,
#       Ex: '0A1' where agent 0 performs Pull(W,W) and agent 1 performs Pull(E,E)
#    In order to check for these, the conflict method should return two lists:
#       a) destinations which contains all newly occupied cells.
#       b) moved_boxes which contains the current position of boxes moved during the action, i.e. their position
#          prior to being moved by the action.
# Note that 'agent_index' is the index of the agent in the state.agent_positions list which is often but *not always*
# the same as the numerical value of the agent character.
